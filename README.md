# ENGO551_Lab3
This is my submission for lab 3 in ENGO551



I will use this list here to keep track of all of my different ChatGPT prompts.
- I want to make a webpage using Flask, html and python that has a map on the first page. Can you generate me a python file with the backend for the page and an html file for the front end of this webpage?
- how should I edit the html file so that the default location is Calgary Alberta?
- I want the map to centre on calgary, without a marker.  Can you write code in html using leaflet in order to centre the map on Calgary alberta with a wide zoom?
- The map now shows up. I need to add the search bars now, in order to be able to query an api for the date. Could you please create these two inputs in both the html and the python?
- can you please centre the search, and make the whole page look nicer?
- can you make it so that the map is always close to the bottom of the page on its bottom edge?
- now the map is in the bottom left corner of the page. Can you make it centred horizontally at the bottom of the page?
